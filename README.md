# The Lipstick Effect on the Big Screen
Analyzing the Correlation Between US Economic Indicators and Popular Media Genres

## Project Overview
This research project investigates the relationship between macroeconomic instability in the United States and shifts in consumer preferences within the entertainment industry. Specifically, it aims to determine whether negative economic indicators—such as rising unemployment rates, high inflation, or falling GDP—correlate with a spike in popularity for "escapist" genres (e.g., Fantasy, Comedy, Adventure) in movies and television series.

## Motivation
The primary motivation for this research is to understand how macroeconomic instability influences the psychological needs of the American public, as reflected in their entertainment choices. Specifically, this project aims to test the validity of the 'Lipstick Effect' in the entertainment industry. In economics, the Lipstick Effect is the theory that during recessions, consumers will still buy expensive goods, but they switch to smaller, affordable luxuries (like premium lipstick) rather than large purchases (like cars or houses).

In this context, a movie ticket or a streaming subscription represents that 'affordable luxury.' This study seeks to understand if economic distress drives a shift toward 'Escapist' genres (Comedy, Fantasy, Adventure) as a coping mechanism, or if audiences prefer 'Realist' or darker genres (Horror, Drama) that mirror their societal anxiety.

## Hypotheses

Null Hypothesis (H0):  There is no significant correlation between US economic downturns (indicated by unemployment rates, inflation, or GDP decline) and the popularity of escapist media genres.

Alternative Hypothesis (H1):  There is a positive correlation between US economic downturns and the popularity of escapist media genres. (i.e., As the economy gets worse, the market share of Comedy/Fantasy increases).


## Data Collecting
A. Economic Data:
 1-) Inflation rate over the years in US.
 2-) Unemployment rate over the years in US.
 3-) GDP over the years in US.
 
    
B. Media Data:
 1-) Most watched Movies in US
 2-) Most watched TV series in US
 3-) If I can't find the most watched list, I will take the average of the view counts and use only those above the average.
